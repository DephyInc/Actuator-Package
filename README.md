# Actuator-Package

The Dephy Actuator Package is a turn-key solution for people who want to test FlexSEA's capabilities or quickly design a prosthetic limb. The Package consists of a custom brushless motor integrated with a FlexSEA-Rigid circuit and a minimalist enclosure, pre-loaded embedded software, and a full suite of high-level software and test scripts.

### Scripts
The fx_plan_stack API is a suite of functions that configure and control FlexSEA devices. Detailed information can be found on the dephy wiki, which is included in the references below.

The repo contains the FlexSEA-Rigid actuator package library and sample programs for Python, MatLab, C. These scripts are accompanied by and are dependent upon C based libraries for both Windows (.dll) and Rasbian(.so).
