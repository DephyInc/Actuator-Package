# Actuator-Package

The Dephy Actuator Package is a turn-key solution for people who want to test FlexSEA's capabilities or quickly design a prosthetic limb. The Package consists of a custom brushless motor integrated with a FlexSEA-Rigid circuit and a minimalist enclosure, pre-loaded embedded software, and a full suite of high-level software and test scripts.

# Scripts
The fx_plan_stack API is a suite of functions that configure and control FlexSEA devices. Detailed information can be found on the dephy wiki, which is included in the references below.

The repo contains the FlexSEA-Rigid actuator package library and sample programs for Python, MatLab, C. These scripts are accompanied by and are dependent upon C based libraries for both Windows (.dll) and Rasbian(.so). 

## What branch should I pull?
For the most recent version of the libraries and scripts, we recommend using master as it is known to be stable. 

**Note:** It is normal you can't download the entire repository. If the only package missing is Flexsea-dephy, there is nothing to be worried about.
