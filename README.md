# Actuator-Package

The Dephy Actuator Package is a turn-key solution for people who want to test FlexSEA's capabilities or quickly design a prosthetic limb. The Package consists of a custom brushless motor integrated with a FlexSEA-Rigid circuit and a minimalist enclosure, pre-loaded embedded software, and a full suite of high-level software and test scripts.

### Scripts
The fx_plan_stack API is a suite of functions that configure and control FlexSEA devices. Detailed information can be found on the Dephy Wiki, which is included in the references below.

The repo contains the FlexSEA-Rigid Actuator Package library and sample programs for C/C++, Python, MATLAB and SIMULINK. These scripts are accompanied by and are dependent upon C based libraries for both Windows (.dll) and Unix(.so). 

### Getting Started
The latest instructions for working with the Actuatory Package and sample programs are located on Dephy's Wiki:
